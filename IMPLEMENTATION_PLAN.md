## Security Considerations

1. API Key Management
   - Encrypted storage
   - Access control
   - Key rotation

2. Authentication & Authorization
   - JWT implementation
   - Role-based access control
   - Session management

3. Data Security
   - SSL/TLS encryption
   - Data validation
   - Rate limiting

## Next Steps
